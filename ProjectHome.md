## About LLFUSE ##

LLFUSE is a set of Python bindings for the low level [FUSE](http://fuse.sourceforge.net/) API. It requires at least FUSE 2.8.0 and supports both Python 2.x and 3.x.

LLFUSE was originally part of [S3QL](http://code.google.com/p/s3ql), but has been factored out so that it can be used by other projects as well.

To download LLFUSE, please visit the [LLFUSE homepage](http://code.google.com/p/python-llfuse/). The documentation can be [read online](http://www.rath.org/llfuse-docs/.) and is also included in the `doc/html` directory of every LLFUSE release.

Please report any bugs on the [issue tracker](http://code.google.com/p/python-llfuse/issues/). For discussion and questions, please use the general [FUSE mailing list](https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/fuse-devel). A searchable [mailing list archive](http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.comp.file-systems.fuse.devel) is kindly provided by [Gmane](http://www.gmane.org/).
